**Project Name: RESTful Pajamas**
* *Internet of Pajamas* - Smart pajamas for parents who want a better way to monitor when their newborns are sleeping or awake.
* Instead of waiting for your child to cry to let you know they are awake, a sensor imbedded in the pajamas tracks motion. Too much activity over a certain period will trigger an alert for the parents, letting you know your baby is now awake. If your baby is asleep the application will confirm.
* Client applications available on Android, iOS and Web. Home server application runs on Raspberry Pi.
